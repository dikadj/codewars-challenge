# Codewars Challenge

Here's my solutions for some Codewars challenge I wrote

### To see my solution

You can go ahead and and open `src/index.js` from this repo

or clone it to your hard drive by

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dikadj/codewars-challenge.git
```
I'm using react, but it doesn't render anything, I just logged them in the console.
To check the console you need to install the dependencies first and run your local server

```sh
$ cd codewars-challenge/
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

When you've done running the server, it's gonna open a blank page in your default browser.
If it doesn't open anything, go ahead and type localhost:3000 in your browser.

### To open console

It depends on the browser you're using,
in Chrome it's going to be `ctrl+shift+I` (Windows) or `ctrl+shift+J` (Mac)
